## Setup

1. Clone this repository
2. Install dependencies:

   ```
3. Create a Discord application and bot at https://discord.com/developers/applications
4. Copy your bot token
5. Install PostgreSQL from https://www.postgresql.org/download/
6. Create a database named `soundboard_stats`
7. Configure the `.env` file with:
   ```
   DISCORD_TOKEN=your_bot_token_here
   DB_USER=postgres
   DB_PASSWORD=your_postgres_password
   DB_HOST=localhost

## Usage

1. Start the bot:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

2. The bot will automatically:
   - Track all soundboard usage in your server
   - Join voice channels when users enter
   - Leave voice channels when only bots remain
   - Store statistics in PostgreSQL database

3. Available Commands:
   - `!soundstats` - Shows a list of all sounds and how many times they've been used
   - `!join` - Manually makes the bot join your current voice channel
   - `!leave` - Manually makes the bot leave the voice channel

## Features

- Soundboard Tracking:
  - Tracks all soundboard usage across servers
  - Displays human-readable sound names instead of IDs
  - Maintains count of how often each sound is used
  - Records emoji and custom/default status for each sound
  - Stores usage history with timestamps

- Automatic Voice Channel Management:
  - Auto-joins voice channels when users enter
  - Auto-leaves when channel is empty (except for bots)
  - Can be manually controlled with commands

- Persistent Storage:
  - PostgreSQL database integration
  - Maintains statistics across bot restarts
  - Efficient querying with database indexing
  - Real-time statistics updates

- Multi-Server Support:
  - Works across multiple servers simultaneously
  - Maintains separate statistics per server
  - Handles concurrent sound usage

## Note

Make sure to:
- Keep your bot token private and never share it with others
- Secure your PostgreSQL credentials
- Ensure the bot has proper permissions in your server
